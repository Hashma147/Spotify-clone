# 📖 Project Description

The Spotify Clone is a frontend web development project that replicates the core design and functionality of the Spotify Web Player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a practice project to enhance skills in responsive design, user interface development, and DOM manipulation using vanilla JavaScript.

This clone allows users to:

View a playlist with song titles and thumbnails.

Play, pause, skip, and seek through songs using a custom audio player.

Visually track the song’s progress through an interactive progress bar.

Enjoy a smooth and responsive layout across devices.
